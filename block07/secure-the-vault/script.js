//PSEUDOCODE:
//To get combinationNumber1, multiply 2 and 5.

let combinationNumber1 = 2*5;

//To get combinationNumber2, divide 80 by 2.
let combinationNumber2 = 80/2;

//To get combinationNumber3, subtract 40 from 1.
let combinationNumber3 = 40-1;

let message = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:"

//Result: 10 - 40 - 39
let result = combinationNumber1 - combinationNumber2 - combinationNumber3;

alert("10-40-39"); //create a popup box and show whatever is in the ( )
alert(message) //invoke the function, use it


//NOTES
